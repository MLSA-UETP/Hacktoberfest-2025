# 🤝 Contributing Guide  
### Welcome to the MLSA UET Peshawar Contributing Guide for Hacktoberfest 2025! 🎉  

Please read this document carefully to ensure your Pull Request (PR) gets successfully merged and counted for Hacktoberfest! 💪  

---

## 📚 Contribution Rules

- ✅ Pull requests should be **meaningful** and your **own original work**.  
- 🚫 **Plagiarism** and **spamming** of any sort are strictly **not allowed**.  
- ⚡ You **may** make funny or weird PRs — but make sure they’re still functional and follow Hacktoberfest’s spirit!  
- 🧱 **Do NOT** add build steps (like `npm install`) — we’re keeping this repo simple and static.  
- 🧩 **Do NOT** remove other contributors’ content.  
- 💅 Your styling or code can be pretty, ugly, simple, or complex — as long as it works!  
- 🧾 Add your **name** to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file after your PR is merged.  
- 🔀 Try to keep PRs **small** to minimize merge conflicts.  
- 🚨 Anyone violating the Hacktoberfest spirit will be flagged, and their PRs won’t count toward the event.

Here’s how to keep it updated 👇

Add the Original Repo as Upstream

git remote add upstream https://github.com/MLSA-UET-Peshawar/Hacktoberfest-2025
```

Verify It’s Added

Sync the Latest Changes
```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
💡 Tip: Use this frequently between your own commits to ensure your fork stays updated!
