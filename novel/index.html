    <h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
    <div class="author">By Robert Frost</div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        <span>Some say the world will end in fire.</span>
        <span>some say in ice. </span>
        <span>from what i've tested of desire</span>
        <span>I hold with those who favor fire</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>But if it had to perish twice,</span>
        <span>I think I know enough of hate</span>
        <span>to say that for destruction ice</span>
        <span>is also great</span>
        <span>and would suffice.</span>
